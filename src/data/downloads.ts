/**
 * The three ServeSync POS installers. GENERATED — run `npm run downloads`.
 *
 * Version, size and release date come from electron-builder's `latest.yml`; the
 * SHA-256 is computed from the artefact itself. Do not edit by hand — a figure
 * typed here that disagrees with the file on the server is worse than no figure.
 *
 * The binaries live on `admin.plutoxtech.com`, not in this repo: GitHub rejects
 * a blob over 100 MB, and three installers would put 320 MB in git history
 * permanently.
